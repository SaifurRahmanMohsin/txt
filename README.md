## Introduction ##
The world has humans and robots. Humans build things (including robots) and they deserve credit for doing so when they do. Robots, on the other hand, do what they are built to do, and sometimes you want to exclude certain behaviors. This plugin helps you to do both of this with ease.

As the title says, it allows you to generate [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/Standard.html) and [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html) for your web app.

## Installation ##
You can use the plugin code **Mohsin.Txt** in your October backend to get this plugin. Enjoy!!!

## Running unit tests ##
If you would like to run the unit tests on this plugin, then run `../../../vendor/bin/phpunit` from the plugin folder.
